The Python scripts eda.py, eda_osm.py and eda_other.py output dataframes with different features (Zensus, etc.). Using total_df.py all the dataframes are merged to get about 200 features for all neighborhoods in all cities. Other dataframes (not generated by the eda files) were derived from other sources (ChatGPT, etc.) and will also be merged into the total_df.csv
